	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {As sensitivities improve and more detectors are added to the global network of gravitational wave observatories, calibration accuracy and precision are becoming increasingly important. Photon calibrators, relying on power-modulated auxiliary laser beams reflecting from suspended interferometer optics, enable continuous calibration by generating displacement fiducials proportional to the modulated laser power. Developments in the propagation of laser power calibration via transfer standards to on-line power sensors monitoring the modulated laser power have enabled generation of length fiducials with improved accuracy. Estimated uncertainties are almost a factor of two smaller than the lowest values previously reported. This is partly due to improvements in methodology that have increased confidence in the results reported. Referencing the laser power calibration standards for each observatory to a single transfer standard enables reducing relative calibration errors between elements of the detector network. Efforts within the national metrology institute community to realize improved laser power sensor calibration accuracy are ongoing.}

In their fifth science run (S5), between November 2005 and October 2007, these detectors accumulated one year of triple coincident data while operating at their designed sensitivity. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the instruments in the S5 data set, including measurement techniques and uncertainty estimation."

	title={Closed form expressions for gravitational multipole moments of elementary solids},
	abstract = {Perhaps the most powerful method for deriving the Newtonian gravitational interaction between two masses is the multipole expansion. Once inner multipoles are calculated for a particular shape, this shape can be rotated, translated, and even converted to an outer multipole with well-established methods. The most difficult stage of the multipole expansion is generating the initial inner multipole moments without resorting to three-dimensional numerical integration of complex functions. Previous work has produced expressions for the low-degree inner multipoles for certain elementary solids. This work goes further by presenting closed-form expressions for all degrees and orders. A combination of these solids, combined with the aforementioned multipole transformations, can be used to model the complex structures often used in precision gravitation experiments.},

The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabryâ€“Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.}

A third LIGO detector, with comparable astrophysical reach, is to be built in India (LIGO-Aundha) and expected to be operational during the latter part of this decade. Such additions to the network increase the number of baselines and the network SNR of GW events. These enhancements help improve the sky-localization of those events. Multiple detectors simultaneously in operation will also increase the baseline duty factor, thereby, leading to an improvement in the detection rates and, hence, the completeness of surveys. In this paper, we quantify the improvements due to the expansion of the LIGO global network in the precision with which source properties will be measured. We also present examples of how this expansion will give a boost to tests of fundamental physics.}

We describe improved understanding and methods used to quantify the response of each detector, with a dedicated effort to define all places where systematic error plays a role. We use the detectors as they stand in the first half (six months) of the third observing run to demonstrate how each identified systematic error impacts the estimated strain and constrain the statistical uncertainty therein. For this time period, we estimate the upper limit on systematic error and associated uncertainty to be <7% in magnitude and <4 deg in phase (68% confidence interval) in the most sensitive frequency band 20â€“2000 Hz. The systematic error alone is estimated at levels of <2% in magnitude and <2 deg in phase.}

	title = {Measurement of the Newtonian constant of gravitation G by precision displacement sensors},
	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {The Newtonian constant of gravitation G historically has the largest relative uncertainty over all other fundamental constants with some discrepancies in values between different measurements. We propose a new scheme to measure G by detecting the position of a test mass in a precision displacement sensor induced by a force modulation from periodically rotating source masses. To seek different kinds of experimental setups, laser interferometers for the gravitational wave detection and optically-levitated microspheres are analyzed. The high sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors to the displacement is advantageous to have a high signal-to-noise ratio of 10âˆ’6 with a few hours of the measurement time, whereas the tunability of parameters in optically-levitated microspheres can enable competitive measurements with a smaller scale setup dedicated to the G measurement. To achieve an accuracy of G better than currently available measurements, developments in force calibration is essential. These measurements can provide an alternative method to measure G precisely, potentially leading to the improvement in the accuracy of G, as well as a better search for non-Newtonian gravity at a length scale ofâ€‰â€‰âˆ¼1 m.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {As sensitivities improve and more detectors are added to the global network of gravitational wave observatories, calibration accuracy and precision are becoming increasingly important. Photon calibrators, relying on power-modulated auxiliary laser beams reflecting from suspended interferometer optics, enable continuous calibration by generating displacement fiducials proportional to the modulated laser power. Developments in the propagation of laser power calibration via transfer standards to on-line power sensors monitoring the modulated laser power have enabled generation of length fiducials with improved accuracy. Estimated uncertainties are almost a factor of two smaller than the lowest values previously reported. This is partly due to improvements in methodology that have increased confidence in the results reported. Referencing the laser power calibration standards for each observatory to a single transfer standard enables reducing relative calibration errors between elements of the detector network. Efforts within the national metrology institute community to realize improved laser power sensor calibration accuracy are ongoing.}

In addition, the method can be used to provide sub-percent calibration in phase and amplitude. Knowledge of calibration to such certainties shall enhance the scientific output of the instruments in the case of an eventual detection of gravitational waves. The method relies on a rotating symmetrical two-body mass, a dynamic gravity field generator (DFG). The placement of the DFG in the proximity of one of the interferometer's suspended test masses generates a change in the local gravitational field detectable with current interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {Shapiro time delay is one of the fundamental tests of general relativity and post-Newtonian theories of gravity. Consequently, its measurements can be used to probe the parameter Î³ which is related to spacetime curvature produced by a unit mass in the post-Newtonian formalism of gravity. To date all measurements of time delay have been conducted on astronomical scales. It was asserted in 2010 that gravitational wave detectors on Earth could be used to measure Shapiro delay on a terrestrial scale via massive rotating systems. Building on that work, we consider how measurements of Shapiro delay can be made using next-generation gravitational wave detectors. We perform an analysis for measuring Shapiro delay with the next-generation gravitational wave detectors Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope to determine how precisely the effect can be measured. Using a rotating mass unit design, we find that Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope can measure the Shapiro delay signal with amplitude signal to noise ratios upwards of âˆ¼28 and âˆ¼43 in 1 year of integration time, respectively. By measuring Shapiro delay with this technique, next-generation interferometers will allow for terrestrial measurements of Î³ in the paramaterized post-Newtonian formalism of gravity with sub-percent precision.}

We show that such an apparatus is feasible (though not easy) to construct, present an example design, and calculate the signal that would be detectable by Advanced LIGO. This offers the first opportunity to measure spacetime curvature effects on a laboratory distance scale.}
